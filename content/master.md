# ðŸŽ§ Master Thesis â€” Nonlinear Loudspeaker Modeling

## Abstract

Loudspeakers are nonlinear electroacoustic systems whose behavior is only partly captured by classical linear models such as Thieleâ€“Small parameters. At large excursions or high input levels, nonlinear effects in the suspension, motor, and enclosure introduce distortions that require more advanced modeling.

This thesis investigates data-driven methods for identifying and modeling these nonlinearities. The focus is on combining physical insight with system identification techniques, including universal approximation and sparse modeling, to develop loudspeaker models that are both accurate and interpretable.

The goal is to improve scientific understanding of nonlinear transducer dynamics and provide modeling tools that support design, diagnostics, and control in audio engineering.
